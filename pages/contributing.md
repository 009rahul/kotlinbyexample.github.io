## Contribute

The site welcomes and encourages community contributions. While the project originators will contribute examples as time permits, the main idea behind this project is for the community
to contribute. To that end, we've tried to make contributions as simple as possible.

### How it works

### How to Contribute

To contribute an example is very straight-forward:

1. Fork the https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinbyexample.git[Kotlin by Example repository]
// TODO
3. Write out your example. Make sure you annotated it properly.
4. Optionally add check to verify the output of your example.
5. Submit a pull request.

### Getting Help

If you get stuck, contact one of the https://twitter.com/hhariri[authors] or reach out to us on http://slack.kotlinlang.org[Kotlin Slack], on the *#kotlin-by-example* channel.
