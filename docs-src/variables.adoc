=== Variables

[source,kotlin]
----
var a : String = "initial" <1>
println(a)

val b : Int = 1  <2>

val c = 3 <3>
----
<1> Declare a mutable variable and initialise it
<2> Declare an immutable variable and initialise it
<3> Declare an immutable variable and initialise it. The compiler infers the type.

Kotlin has powerful type inference. While you can explicitly declare the type of a variable, you'll usually let the
compiler do the work by inferring it. While Kotlin does not enforce immutability, it is recommended. In essence use `val` over `var`.

[source,kotlin-snippet]
----
var e : Int <1>
>>> println(e) <2>
----
<1> Declare a mutable variable, but don't initialise it.
<2> Error: Variable 'e' must be initialized
