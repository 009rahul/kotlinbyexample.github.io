=== Variable

[source,kotlin]
----
fun main(args: Array<String>) {

    var a : String = "initial" <1>
    println(a)

    val b : Int = 1  <2>

    val c = 3 <3>
}

<1> Declare a mutable variable and initialise it
<2> Declare an immutable variable and initialise it
<3> Declare an immutable variable and initialise it. The compiler infers the type.

Kotlin has powerful type inference. While you can explicitly declare the type of a variable, you'll usually let the
compiler do the work by inferring it.

Also, while Kotlin does not enforce immutability, it is recommended. In essence use `val` over `var`.
