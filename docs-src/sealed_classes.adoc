=== Sealed Classes

[source,kotlin]
----
sealed class Mammal(val name: String) <1>

class Cat(val catName: String) : Mammal(catName)
class Human(val humanName: String, val job: String) : Mammal(humanName)


fun greetMammal(mammal: Mammal): String {
    when (mammal) { <2>
        is Human -> return "Hello ${mammal.name}; You're working as a ${mammal.job}"
        is Cat -> return "Hello ${mammal.name}"
        // `else` clause not required, all the cases covered  <3>
    }
}

----

<1> A sealed class is defined with two subclasses which must be in the same file
<2> The sealed class is used as an argument for a `when` expression 
<3> The `else` clause is not necessary because all subclasses of the sealed class are covered. 
This is contrary to ordinary super classes, where an `else` would always be needed.
